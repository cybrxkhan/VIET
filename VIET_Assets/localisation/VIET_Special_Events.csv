hit_by_a_meteor;[Root.Location.GetName] is hit by a meteor!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.0.desc;I was in the middle of my business when I was interrupted by a deafening sound. I rush to the nearest window, and the next thing I saw was a blinding flash of fiery light.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.0.a;WHAT IN THE NAME OF OBLIVION IS THAT -;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.1.title;A Fiery Ball of Death;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.1.desc;In all the years of recorded history, there has never been a calamity as terrible as this one. [From.Location.GetName] has been struck by a large, fiery ball of death, a meteor - so large and bright that there are rumors that even the people of Cathay and Nippon witnessed it.\n\nThousands and thousands are dead, entire settlements have been leveled, fires rage across the land, and a massive dark cloud of ash and smoke cover the region. Those unfortunate enough to survive will have to deal with the unrest and anarchy that follow in the wake of such a disaster, but how can anyone rebuild after this?\n\nThere are now some that even say the apocalypse is upon us!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.1.a;Terrible! May their souls have peace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.2.desc;[From.Location.GetName] has been the very target of a large meteor impact. The dead are in the tens if not hundreds of thousands, and the destruction is massive. Even after we deal with the influx of refugees and any clean-up attempts, [From.Location.GetName] will suffer for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.2.a;How could this happen?;;;;;;;;;;;x
killed_by_meteors;It's certain that many currently in [From.Location.GetName] - some of your courtiers, vassals, family members, and even you yourself - are among the dead or injured.;;;;;;;;;;;x
killed_by_meteors_distant;Although [Root.Location.GetName] wasn't directly hit by the meteor, it did suffer in the aftermath. It's possible that many currently there - some of your courtiers, vassals, family members, and even you yourself - are among the dead or injured.;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETdisaster.7.desc;Before anybody has time to react, there is a huge explosion. You awake moments later in the middle of a large field of rubble, corpses, and raging fires. Unfortunately, it seems you have nasty cuts and wounds, and while it hurts, you quickly realize you were lucky to be alive, or, even better, with all your body parts intact.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.7.a;You wander aimlessly, hoping to find any other survivors.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETdisaster.8.desc;Before anybody has time to react, there is a huge explosion. You awake moments later in the middle of a large field of rubble, corpses, and raging fires, feeling great pain. It appears you've been maimed! However, you know in your heart it could've been worse. Thankfully a few other survivors nearby hear your cries and groans, and they help pull you out of the rubble.;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETdisaster.10.desc;You saw the fiery ball of destruction as it fell. Just as you and your companions try to comprehend what just happened, a large cloud of smoke and ash appear.
