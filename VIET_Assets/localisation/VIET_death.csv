VIETmisc.500.desc;As you pass into the afterlife, you know that no matter what, Britain will do well and prosper. No matter what, Britain was in a much better situation than when you were born. What a great struggle it was! But you managed, somehow, to turn the tide of fate and reclaim Britain for the Britons. “Like” King Arthur? No, many believe, you are more than a pale imitation of Arthur, you are the very incarnation of Arthur himself!\n\nBards will sing of your heroic deeds and remarkable legacy. Men from across Europe will speak your name in awe. And Britain, glorious Britain - long may she live under your successors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
