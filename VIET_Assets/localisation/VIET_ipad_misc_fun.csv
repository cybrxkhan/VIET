VIETmisc.2016.desc;A new cosmetic popular among the noblewomen is made using the egg yolk of from quail eggs instead of the usual chicken eggs. But quail eggs are a rare luxury much more suited for gourmet food. Are these women truly vain?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2016.a;A useless product!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2016.b;I could've eaten those eggs... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2016.c;This does not concern me. The fad will pass in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2016.d;I think it looks nice on me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2017.desc;Yesterday was a local traditional festival held annually in the city. During the night, while I was away celebrating, some drunk and inconsiderate revelers dared to egg the front of my house! Now I have to pay to clean it up.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2017.a;Maybe those hooligans were sent by my business rivals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2018.desc;Yesterday I went to the local tavern and had too much beer. While drunk I ordered a large amount of pickled eggs to eat with my beer, as I usually do. However, this time, in my drunkeness I must have taken and paid for all the pickled eggs the tavern had. Now do I not only have to deal with my hangover, I have to figure out what to do with these eggs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2018.a;Looks like we'll be eating pickled eggs for a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2019.desc;Today you visited one of your vassals. While there, both of you dined on a delicious sponge cake... or, at least, it was delicious until both of you nearly choked on eggshells. Now my vassal is highly embarrassed by his cook's incompetency at cooking with eggs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2019.a;And he should be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2019.b;It's no matter, things happen all the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2020.desc;For dinner tonight I'll be having deviled eggs. What should be stuffed in these eggs, I wonder? My cook will make them taste good regardless of what's inside them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2020.a;Vegetables. Who says abstaining from excess isn't delicious?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2020.b;Meat. I want something to strengthen me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2020.c;Milk, cream, or cheese. It shall taste richer and fatten me well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2021.desc;The unbeliever is brought before you to be sentenced. He refuses to repent and change from his erroneous ways. Ha! It is amazing there are people who do not believe in the Dulcinian faith. He is corrupted - but can he still be purified and without being executed?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2021.a;Death is the only way this wretch can be purified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2021.b;Spare him. Didn't Jesus teach us to be merciful?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2021.c;The Catholics would hunt and kill us. Let us not be hypocrites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2022.desc;The Dulcinian faith teaches me that it is acceptable to plunder and kill "good" Christians who support a corrupt hierarchy of clergy or go against us, for we are pure in our belief. Can we truly be pure if we kill our enemies, even if they are corrupt?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2022.a;Of course! God's creation must be purified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2022.b;I am starting to have my doubts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2023.desc;This commoner has nerve! He says your vassal should give him and their other neighbors money. We are good Dulcinians, after all, he argues, who live in an equal society - why does this noble then hoard money and luxuries and refuse to share it with others? However, your vassal refuses to give anything.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2023.a;Be a good Dulcnian my vassal, share the wealth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2023.b;Ideals are good, but in the real world we can't always abide by them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2024.desc;Do you remember that worthless knight, the one who was found guilty of irredeemably corrupt according to Dulcinian doctrine? He was just purified yesterday - that is, his soul redeemed (that is, he was executed most effectively). Now you have all his precious belongings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2024.a;Stuff for free! Ah, it's great when people are... "purified".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2024.b;Let's share the knight's things with the needy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2025.desc;Peasants in one of your provinces accused a minor noble of being corrupt, betraying the Dulcinian doctrine of equality and charity. Wishing to "purify" him, they lynched him, torched his house, and killed his entire family, including his innocent young newborn child!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2025.a;These damn peasants! They take our faith too seriously!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2025.b;If a baby were corrupted, I'd "purify" that worthless piece of trash too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2026.desc;I've been drinking out late at night with two of your favorite servants. As I walk home, the three of you spot an old man on a rickety old cart. My servants, still intoxicated, throw stones at the cart, breaking one of the axles. They laugh and tell me to join in, but feel something's not right. What's an old man like that doing in the middle of the night?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2026.a;I'll help the old man fix his cart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2026.b;Run away! Who knows what that old bloke is up to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2026.c;Ignore the man and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2027.tooltip;You help the mysterious old man.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2027.desc;This morning my two favorite servants were found dead of natural causes (apparently, you were told). What more, a large patch of my hair somehow turned white. I just know it had to do something with that mysterious old man I met yesterday.... Wait, heaven protect me! I know who that old man was, it was Ankou, the henchman of death!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2027.a;No one must know of what happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
met_ankou;Met Ankou;;;;;;;;;;;x
met_ankou_desc;There are rumors that this character met the Breton henchman of death.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2028.desc;As I am drinking chouchen - Breton cider mixed with honey - with my courtiers, one of them suggests adding some bee venom into it to increase it's intoxicating effects. "I've tried it before, in one of the smaller villages," the courtier claims. "It is an extraordinary experience!";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2028.a;Are you insane? This is strong enough for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2028.b;Yes, I like the sound of that. Let's find some bee venom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2029.desc;We have some guests from afar coming tonight, and I wish to serve them some of the finest Breton crepes. Should we serve them sweet or savory?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2029.a;Sweet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2029.b;Savory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2029.c;"Why not both?" your child says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
yay_mexican_girl;Your courtiers cheer and lift the girl up in jubilation at her brilliant idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2030.desc;I live near the sea, and thus my ears constantly suffer from the loud shouts of the traditional hues - cliff top lookouts who help fishermen. They constantly shout "hevva, hevva!" to alert the fishermen as to where the fish are. We Cornish love our fish, but all this shouting is driving me crazy!";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2030.a;Gah! I can't do much. We need the fishermen if we want fish, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2031.desc;I am about to sail on a short voyage to one of the local seaside towns for some official business. I bring with me some good old Cornish pasties (those delicious succulent meats in pastry dough!) on board the ship, but one of the sailors pleads me not to. "It's bad luck to bring pasties on board! Throw it off deck, that the dead mariners be at peace, my liege!";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2031.a;Ha ha, no way. I like these delicious pasties too much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2031.b;Very well, very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_believed_superstition;Believed superstition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_ignored_superstition;Ignored superstition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2032.desc;While visiting one of the local monasteries, I come across the monastery kitchen. There the monks have stocked a lot of rather bland foods - most likely to ensure their temperate lifestyle stays temperate. One of the monks tells me, "We have too much clotted cream, my liege. Perhaps we can gift you some for use in your feasts.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2032.a;Clotted cream? Something all Cornish appreciate! I’ll take it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2032.b;Give it to the poor and needy instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2033.desc;A Rowan tree of great magical powers has been discovered in one of the provinces I rule. Experts on the local lore says that the tree appears to have a certain special appearance and properties. For as long as it stands, it will protect the surrounding region.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2033.a;A sign of good fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_rowan_tree;Magical Rowan Tree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_rowan_tree_desc;The local Britons believe that a Rowan tree in this province is full of magical properties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2034.desc;A small hill-fort was recently discovered near your residence. Old indeed, it appears to have been a fortification built by your Briton ancestors to protect themselves in the turmoil following the fall of the Roman Empire centuries ago.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2034.a;What a dark yet heroic age it must have been, the age of Arthur!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
inspired_by_heritage;Inspired by Heritage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2035.desc;To be honest, as much as I admire King Arthur (for he is a hero to us Britons), I have to admit the basis of his authority as a powerful feudal lord - the lady of the lake giving him Excalibur - is a bit weak. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for the feudal contract, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2035.a;But it is his deeds that matter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2035.b;He was given the right to rule by the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2035.c;Who expects to wield power because a watery tart threw a sword at them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#REFERENCES;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2500.desc;Being a [Root.GetTitle] is dangerous as I have many enemies who want to kill me. Sometimes this makes me worry a lot. Today I even admitted to my beloved [Lover.GetName] that sometimes I fear [Lover.GetSheHe] is plotting my murder. Upon hearing this, [Lover.GetSheHe] responded, "Of course I want to be the one to kill you. If I kill you, I'll be the one closest to your deathbed.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2500.a;You're so sweet and romantic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2500.b;I don't want that kind of twisted love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2500.c;Ha ha, you always cheer me up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2500.d;You really are trying to kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2501.desc;One of your courtiers is ridiculously lazy despite having the sort of talent men would envy. I keep trying to push this courtier to do something, to contribute to the world, to no avail. When I asked the reason for all this laziness, I got this reply: "If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to do it, I'll make it quick. Look, I'm not lazy. I'm just conserving my energy.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2501.a;Conserving energy to do what? Sleep all day?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2501.b;Heh. I like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2502.desc;I have in my court a brilliant woman. Yet, when she is asked why and how she knows everything (so it seems), she always meekly replies, "I don't know everything. I just know what I know.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2502.a;Bah, she's trying to pretend she's so "humble.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2502.b;I respect such an attitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2502.c;She accepts her position as a member of the docile gender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2503.desc;People say I am mad? Ha! I am the most powerful ruler alive. I am the great [Root.GetTitle], who can command the greatest armies on earth, who can make love to any and all living things! Today, I will do something satisfying, something worthy of my greatness. Why, I'll eat something... I'll take something stupendous and eat it. Yes, that's it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2503.a;I'll take my sister... AND EAT HER.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2503.b;I'll take this Incan potato... AND EAT IT.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dn_lunatic_a;Maybe I can brush her teeth too... [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] knows what I mean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_b;I love these occidental vegetables, especially when they're cut thinly and fried!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_c;Anyone who doesn't like baklava... WILL DIE! MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_d;First though I need to find some falafel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_e;I will protect my Jewish subjects, for I love their music! It speaks to the soul...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_f;People question why I think all Italians are ugly? It's they who are mad, not me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_g;That should make the peasants shut up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_h;Nobody steals my sweetrolls! NOBODYYYYYYYY!!!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_i;And consequently become divine! Immortal! Invincible! BWAHOHOHOHOHOHO...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dn_lunatic_j;It is better to be feared than loved!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2504.desc;Your face is buried in your hands as you sit on your chair. You feel like you almost want to cry, or scream, or something. Life, it is so difficult! Your plans, always gone astray. Your hopes, always dashed. Your dreams, always destroyed. I'm in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2504.a;Having no sister to "comfort me" has left me in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2504.b;My realm's troubles has left me in despair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2505.desc;"Nice boat," my lover comments, as we are inspecting one of my family's ships leaving port on a business trip.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2505.a;Why, thank you, that's so kind of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2505.b;Are you... YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL ME!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2506.desc;I am sitting there quietly, eating my meal when someone joins me. Someone who is, to be specific, either unhinged or simply annoying.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2506.a;"Hello there, my courtier," I say, trying to be polite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2507.tooltip;Oh heaven save me, they have that atrociously stupid and hideous smile on their face again...;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIET_yes_angry;I WILL STAY CALM. I WILL STAY CALM. I WLSTAY CALM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2509.desc;A moment later, thanks to your well-timed punch, [From.GetFirstName] lies on the floor, half-conscious, muttering something about yellow flying cats.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2509.a;Goodness gracious, I'm glad I don't have to deal with that madman everyday...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2510.desc;It is early in the morning, and I am awoken to a loud sound. I look upwards, and gaze at my bedroom door. There stands my daughter, holding a glistening, shiny knife, with the most horrific smile on her face. She says cheerfully, "You woke up yourself. That's too bad.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2510.a;What are you doing... with that knife -;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.desc;"I was checking to see if you were awake yet," my daughter says just as I am about to make a run for it. "I'm helping the cook make some meat for breakfast, daddy, and we wanted to surprise you! Oh well. What meat would you like to eat later?";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.a;IN THE NAME OF [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] PUT THAT KNIFE DOWN.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.b;Oh! Hmm... I'll take chicken?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.c;You will not be cooking. It is improper for someone of your status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2511.d;Cook whatever, I don't care, let me go back to sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2512.desc;We are all good Dulcinians, engaging in prayer to assure God of our purify and faith, when my courtier bursts in, saying, "Penitenziagite! Watch out for the draco who cometh in futurum to gnaw your anima! La morte e supremos. You contemplatum the apocalypsum. La-bas, nous avons il diabolo, ugly comme Salvatore;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2512.b;Do not interrupt us. Unless you want to be... purified?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2512.c;You really are as ugly as you claim to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Cretan Fun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.desc;Peasants nearby discovered a buried bull-shaped vase in the Cretan countryside. It doesn't appear to be of any contemporary style, and perhaps dates to ancient times. Discussing the matter with some local scholars, it seems that the Cretan pagans worshipped bulls.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.a;It would make a nice decoration in my bedroom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.b;Perhaps I could sell it, given it is in good condition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.c;Discard this pagan, heathen contraption! It is evil!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2036.d;I notice many bull-shaped objects lying around Crete... I should study them more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2037.desc;As you sip on your Cretan wine and take a bite into the delicious Kalitsounia pie with herbs and sweet cheese, the musician approaches, holding the traditional Cretan lyra in his hands. "O [Root.GetTitledFirstName], for my next improvisation, shall I sing of love, or shall I sing of death?";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2037.a;Sing of love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2037.b;Sing of death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2037.c;These Cretan cheese pies are DELICIOUS - wait, you said something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2038.desc;Another vendetta has broken out among two prominent Cretan families under your rule. These families aren't too powerful, relatively speaking, but they are powerful and influential enough that their activities are causing a lot of havoc in the area. This isn’t the first time you’ve heard of problems like this on Crete...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2038.a;Gah! These simpleton villagers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2038.b;Put an end to this feud. Now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2039.desc;On the mountainsides and gorges of Crete are plenty of plants called "Cretan Dittanies." I've been told by many Cretans that there is no better way to prove one's love than traversing the difficult terrain to collect these plants when they bloom with lovely pink flowers - not to mention there are rumors they are an excellent aphrodisiac!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2039.a;Why would I risk my life for these stupid plants?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2039.b;I'll get some for my lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2039.c;I'll get some for my spouse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9000.desc;Crete has produced quality wines since time immemorial, and it is an important part of local culture and tradition - festivals are constantly held throughout the year in different parts of the island to celebrate grapes and good drink. This year, you’ve found some time to attend one of these festivals.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9000.a;Fun awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9001.tooltip;You prepare to attend one of the local Cretan wine festivals and set off for the village where a festival will soon be held.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9001.title;The Wines of Crete;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9001.desc;The wine festival is just as exciting as you expected. As you arrive at the village, you see hundreds of people - commoner and noble alike - gather to take part. There’s much to do, be it drinking delicious wines, participating in the many traditional Cretan dances, or enjoying the good food! You can’t believe you don’t come to these celebrations more often.\n\nFriends, guests, even passersby lifting their glasses to toast, and wishing well to each other. Instruments start play. Hearts warm up. Arms open. Spirits are high! Big Cretan men lead the dance, while women and men alike sing traditional songs. People exchange smiles, banters, good feelings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9001.a;This is good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cretan_festival_next;The festival is well under way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9002.tooltip;Drinking wine is fun!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9002.desc;No wonder Crete is famous for its wines! They are many and of great quality. You’re sampling the various different wines available, including the notoriously strong “raki” or “tsikoudia.” As you continue sipping on the fine wine, a few of the local men - burly, big fellows with the infamous Cretan mustaches - invite you to join them in the drinking contests!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9002.a;No thanks, I've drunk enough for now. Maybe later!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9002.b;Haha! I’ll beat these amateurs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9003.tooltip;I have to remember when I can and can’t dance, though, the Cretan locals can be quite fussy about the rules of dancing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9003.desc;Cretans sure love to dance! The locals have so many dances, it’s hard to keep track of which is which - trizalis, tsiniaris, kanelia, ntames, pidikhtos, and the energetic war dance, the pentozali, which is full of high jumping. Men and women alike are running and jumping and twirling and twisting with unrestrained liveliness.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9003.a;Maybe I should join in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9004.tooltip;So much good food, so much good food!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9004.desc;There is so many types of Cretan food. Simple peasant meals, perhaps, but they’re delicious! Kalitsounia sweet cheese pies, traditional Dacos bread, Cretan sausages and cheeses, pomegranates, chestnuts…;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9004.a;One would think I’m at a food festival, not a wine festival!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9005.desc;Unfortunately, all good things have to come to an end. The wine festival concludes, and you must return home. It will be a while before you’ll find time in your schedule to visit one of these local celebrations, but perhaps it wouldn’t be a bad idea to come back in the future. After all, it’s rare for you to experience that much excitement and merriment in such a sort time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9005.a;Now back to my dull old life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9006.desc;As you ride upon your horse, into the horizon, you gaze one last time at the village you just visited for the wine festival. A few of the villagers are still milling about, perhaps with hangovers. Absentmindedly, you shout goodbye to the them. To your surprise, they cheerfully shout farewell back at you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9006.a;Haha! I’ll miss you all! It was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9007.desc;Crete's prosperity is undeniable! Muslims from the Levant and North Africa keep coming in order to seek their fortune from Crete's commercial opportunities. Today, one such man came to my court, seeking to serve me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.9007.a;Very well, we will allow him to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2514.b;Ooook, I've heard enough. Out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2515.desc;Without thinking twice you run outside with the old man to begin your quest. When you reach the courtyard he draws a piece of chalk and uses it to draw a game of hopscotch on the floor. 'Avatar! Before you lies a test of dexterity!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2518.desc;Your guide is in the middle of telling you for the 9th time just how important your quest is when you two stumble upon a clearing in the forest. Suddenly the old man becomes alarmed and starts pacing back and forth as if looking for something on the ground or in the sky. You become alarmed that you may have been led to a trap as the man start muttering 'There was supposed to be a fortune teller... cards...skills... No! You are not the Avatar! I was wrong!' With this is runs away with unprecedented dexterity, leaving you to wonder what just happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2518.a;What is this I don't even...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2519.desc;It's been a while since you rushed outside ready to go on an adventure because an old men said you are some sort of 'Avatar', but clearly your courtiers haven't forgot and it's still a source of laughter now and then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2519.a;May I remind you who rules this realm?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2519.b;A mere mortal can dream, can't he...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2520.desc;'Remove the saxon remove the saxon! To our saxon cousins you may come to our country you may live in the farm! (...) Battle of Badon best day of my life, take a bath of death saxon hahahaha (...)' It seems the troupe of jesters performing to yuor court decided to try a rauchy song... Your briton courtiers are laughing, but your saxon ones... not so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2520.a;What a joyous and catchy tune!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2520.b;To the stocks with these jesters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
remove_kebab_insult;A really bad joke;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.desc;Not again! While passing by some Chinese travelers at the local market today, I heard them commenting on the beauty of [Root.Culture.GetName] women. Why are these Chinese so obsessed with our women? Apparently they’ll call even the ugliest [Root.Culture.GetName] girl a “flower unlike any other”! Haha!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.a;The silly Chinese don’t know where to look for real [Root.Culture.GetName] beauties!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.b;Admittedly I find the attention flattering…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.c;Admittedly I find the attention creepy…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.d;We DO have the most beautiful women in the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.e;Beauty in the eye of the beholder, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2040.f;I find their inability to judge beauty more amusing than infuriating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2041.desc;Today I’ve learned that our great Sogdian language provided the barbarian Turks with many important terms they did not have previously, such as debt.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2041.a;We have many great accomplishments, undoubtedly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2041.b;It’s thanks to us the Turks were able to do anything in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2042.desc;The old murals that decorate your palace are beginning to deteriorate - they were painted centuries ago, after all. Now is a good time to renovate these murals, perhaps even re-do them with completely new murals. Typically, Sogdian murals tend to focus on either of three things: the divine, heroes, or fables. What shall the new murals focus on?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2042.a;The divine - gods and spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2042.b;The heroes - brave men like Rostam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2042.c;The fables - lessons we all should remember.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2042.d;I don’t want to waste money on this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2043.desc;While passing by one of the local Sogdian villages, you happen to encounter a woman and her infant child. Feeling generous, you offer her child a bit of rock sugar, a traditional Sogdian gift for newborns and children. The sugar symbolizes the hope that when the child grows up that his words be sweet...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2043.a;We Sogdians shall forever be the best traders and diplomats in the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2044.desc;Growing up as a Sogdian child has its disadvantages. Everybody expects you to do well in commerce one day. It’s as if all the adults can think about is money, ways to make money, ways to produce more money, money, money, money, money…;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2044.a;Greed is good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2045.desc;A lesser nobleman in my realm gave me an hourglass as a gift. It should help me keep track of time.;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIET_efficient_time_desc;This character efficiently keeps track of time in order to maximize productivity.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2046.desc;Oh no! I overslept and was late to this morning's meeting with my advisors!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2046.a;Why didn't the servants wake me on time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2047.desc;One of my newest personal servants is a diligent fellow, determined even. He always makes sure I do things on time - it pays to have a servant like him!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2047.a;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2048.desc;A big fire broke out in a peasant village uncomfortably close to my residence. Thankfully the local temple had a water clock so large it had enough water to douse the flames.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2048.a;Thank goodness everything’s fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2048.b;We must help those poor peasants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2049.desc;The sun is high above - it’s noontime, isn’t it? And it is rather hot outside. You’ve been out for a bit too long doing whatever business you were doing, and you’re starting to feel a little light-headed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2049.a;Better retreat inside into the shade, maybe drink some water too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2049.b;I have some business to finish, unfortunately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2050.desc;Oh dear, it seems like I've misplaced one of my rings. Goodness gracious, what am I to do?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2050.a;Oh well... hopefully we'll find it....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2050.b;Why should I worry about it when there are more important things at stake?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2051.desc;One of my courtiers seems to be sad. Why I asked why, I learned that their favorite horse was very ill, and unlikely to survive. I remember this steed was a fine specimen, worthy of honor and praise, who brought its master much prestige and joy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2051.a;Such is life, unfortunately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2051.b;Why should I worry about it when there are more important things at stake?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2052.desc;My life is terrible.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2052.a;Why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2053.desc;I feel exhausted...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2053.a;So exhausted...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2054.desc;I threw up on someone!;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2055.tooltip;Uh-oh...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2055.desc;That little brat [From.GetFirstName] threw up on me while we were dining.;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2057.desc;While traveling to a nearby town on official business you come across a corpse on the side of the road. Upon further inspection, it appears to be a beggar who died of who knows what.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2057.a;Ignore the corpse and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2057.b;Inspect it - maybe the beggar has something of use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_beggar_corpse_inspect;“What?” you say as everyone looks at you, bewildered. “Beggars might carry useful things! I read it in a story once!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2058.desc;As one of your guards approaches the beggar, the old man suddenly jumps up. Everyone shouts in surprise, and your guard nearly cuts down the man by accident. It seems like the beggar was actually just in deep sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2058.a;Haha, what a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2058.b;Haha, have a coin, beggar, and [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] bless you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2058.c;Kill that bastard! He dares offend me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2059.desc;The beggar has nothing useful. That's to be expected. Behind you, someone says, “What sort of [Root.GetTitle] goes around searching beggars, anyways?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2059.a;I feel foolish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIET_ridiculous_greed_desc;The lengths this character would go to satisfy their greed are shocking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2060.desc;The beggar seems to have a precious amulet of some sort - your suspicions were correct! Yet you can’t help but wonder. Why did he keep it, when he could have sold it for money? Did he steal it, and was unable to sell it? Or was it something so precious to him he couldn’t bear to part with it? Or was he just plain stupid?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2060.a;It’s mine now, at any rate. I probably can sell it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2064.a;It's lovely, isn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2065.desc;Today’s sunset is particularly beautiful. Words can’t describe it.;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2066.desc;Making love to my beloved during the sunset was a magical experience. My lover may not understand why sunsets appeal to me, but that’s fine.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2066.a;While the sun may set, something else rises...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2067.desc;I’ve learned that one of my courtiers enjoys watching sunsets, just like me. Yesterday we watched the sunset together, and found that despite our differences, we both shared many things as well.;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2068.a;Who would care about my life, anyways?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2069.desc;This itch is really bothersome. I can't stop scratching it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2069.a;I look like a fool in front of my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2070.desc;A tree above me sways gently, its shadow caressing my face. Nearby, I hear the water quietly running down to the fountain below. Birds chirp, and insects buzz. Yes! When I sit in the garden to relax, I feel closer to Allah, and feel his compassion, his mercy, the ingenuity of his designs. It’s as if I can see all of nature before me, from the desert warmth to the ocean breeze.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2070.a;Also, it's a good place to take a nice nap.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2071.desc;Something smells funny….\n\nNever mind, the smell went away.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2071.a;Must’ve been my mind playing tricks on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2072.desc;In the middle of a conversation with a courtier, you pause, suddenly. You forgot what you were going to say next.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2072.a;I hate it when that happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2073.desc;Some disgustingly horrific, vile thought just entered my mind. Try as I might, I can’t get rid of it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2073.a;If I told my court, they’d think me a lunatic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2073.b;Then again, this isn’t the weirdest thing I’ve thought of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2074.desc;For the past few weeks, your court has been short on baklava. Thankfully, a new batch has just arrived from the local baklava merchants! Praise be to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2074.a;Now out of my way, fools, I have baklava to eat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2075.desc;There is a large clump of dirt under one of my fingernails.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2075.a;Who cares.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2075.b;Better remove it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2076.desc;The weather is unusually pleasant today.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2076.a;A good day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2077.desc;Eerie, loud noises were heard at night in some of the nearby villages not too long ago. They were sometimes accompanied by strange colors in the sky. Investigation by our officials and soldiers could not determine as to what was the cause.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2077.a;Frightening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2078.desc;A strange report from one of your messengers! It appears that every inhabitant of one of the villages in your realm has mysteriously vanished a year ago. Many have searched far and wide, but none were able to where any of these villagers went. Were they murdered? Wandered away? Kidnapped by bandits or otherworldly beings?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2078.a;Seems like supernatural forces at work. Heavens preserve us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2079.desc;While eating, you accidentally put way too much salt on your food, mistaking it for sugar or cheese or something of that sort.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2079.a;This tastes horrible! Too salty, too salty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2080.desc;While holding court, I notice one of my courtiers is picking their nose.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2080.a;Disgusting! I should look away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2080.b;I should draw attention to and embarrass them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2080.c;Well, I like picking my nose too, so I don't see what's the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2081.desc;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO -\n\nOh, never mind. I thought my baklava disappeared, but it was just behind my goblet.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2081.a;I did look like a fool, though, but I have no regrets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2082.desc;While having intercourse with my lover, feeling the curves of their body, tickling the places that bring pleasure, and doing other intimate things with them, I notice a strange smell. It's a pleasant smell, but one I don't recognize. Could it... never mind, the smell goes away as quickly as it came.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2082.a;Probably just imagining things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2083.desc;Lately, I've been able to last longer in bed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2083.a;Bring on the fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2084.desc;I've heard rumors that the Emperors of Cathay are so virile that they have thousands of beautiful young concubines and make love with ten or more of them every night.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2084.a;I wish I had thousands of beautiful women with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2084.b;I'm content with the relationships I already have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2084.c;Who would want to live in such a sinful lifestyle?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2084.d;I feel sorry for the Emperor, having to put up with so many women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2085.desc;Last night, I dreamt of making love to the most beautiful person I ever met.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2085.a;I’m still feeling a bit aroused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2086.desc;In your realm, stories have spread of a conman who sells “charms” to unsuspecting children. Some have said that these charms are actually real, others claim they are fake. Some say the fake ones are as effective if not more than real charms, and yet others believe the opposite. Regardless, the conman seems to have mysteriously left for other lands.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2086.a;I wonder whether he was a real conman, or a fake one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2087.desc;Three pretty wenches throw themselves at you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2087.a;YES!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2087.b;I'm not in the mood for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_foursome_aw_yeah;Three beauties at once? The only thing better than this is...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2088.desc;Unfortunately, it seems three wenches were too much for you, and you exhausted yourself way too quickly. In other words, you were a bit too eager, and embarrassed yourself due to your lack of stamina.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2088.a;Now I’ll be a laughingstock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2088.b;I have no regrets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2089.desc;You had a great tumble with those three wenches. Rumors are now spreading about your insatiable lust and great virility.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2089.a;I feel like a real, manly man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2090.desc;While visiting one of the local taverns, you spot a barmaid, unusually attractive for a peasant. You starting making a move on her, but unlike other wenches you’ve come across, she begs for you to leave her alone. She dare refuses you, so mighty and powerful! She should be serving your needs, no?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2090.a;I'll do with her as I wish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2090.b;It is wrong to force her like this. I shall leave her alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_barmaid_harassment;You can't wait to satisfy your lust.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2091.desc;As you rip her clothes off, and start having your way with her, you fail to notice a dark figure nearby. Before you or your guards can react, a man - who could be her husband, brother, father, friend, or someone else - jumps on you, screaming for you to leave her alone, and begins stabbing you. Though your guards quickly take care of him, it’s too late.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2091.a;Gugghhhh....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_you_deserved_it_for_harassing_barmaid;Before you pass out, you hear someone mutter, "That's what he gets for trying to mess with a girl like that.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2092.desc;What an amazing dream I had last night! After waking up, I rush over to one of my servants, and begin excitedly telling her about the dream. "You see, last night, I dreamt that I was... um, well, the dream mainly revolved around... uh....";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2092.a;Crap, I forgot what it was about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2093.desc;While out and about, visiting one of the local towns, I saw a most peculiar scene. A young man seemed to be gifting a friend of his a roasted bird, for food, but when his friend took the bird, it sprang to life! It was never dead in the first place. The friend looked terrified, while the young man only laughed at his successful prank.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2093.a;That was funny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2093.b;I should ask him how he did that... I want to try such a prank!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2094.desc;I farted so loudly everyone must have heard me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2094.a;Um...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2095.desc;While making love, I farted at a most unfortunate time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2095.a;That killed the mood quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2096.desc;I can’t believe it! One of my courtiers absolutely detests one of my favorite stories. Who could even think of criticizing it? Every time I hear a bard sing it I am absolutely spellbound. It has great character development, engaging dialogue, thought provoking themes, and deep symbolism.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2096.a;I admit it can be lewd here and there, but surprisingly this enhances it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2097.desc;If my life was simply a bard’s tale, what kind of story would it be, I wonder?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2097.a;Romance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETmisc.2097.c;Epic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2097.d;Allegory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2098.desc;Lately there’s been a fad amongst the younger people, where they tilt their head in strange or awkward positions in order to emphasize things they say in the middle of a discussion. These “head tilts” are supposed to make them look imposing or mysterious. To my surprise, I’m pretty good at it myself and unlike the youths, I can pull it off well without looking like a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2098.a;My neck is very flexible! Now fear me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2098.b;That said, I don’t want to partake in this stupid fad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2099.desc;I accidentally bit my tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2099.a;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2100.desc;One of my courtiers' has rather bad teeth, even though we have the tools available to maintain acceptable standards of oral hygiene, such as the miswak, the teeth-cleaning twig. I decide to discuss the matter with my courtier one day, and quote a Hadith: "Make a regular practice of Miswak for verily it is the purification for the mouth and a means of the pleasure of the Lord.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2100.a;Your bad breath offends the Prophets and Allah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2101.desc;In one Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) was quoted as saying that "were it not that I might overburdened the Believers I would have ordained them to use Miswak at the time of every prayer." Usage of miswak, the teeth-cleaning twig, is surely a sign of piety! It may be a good idea to vow that I'll use the miswak before every prayer as much as I can.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2101.a;A good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2101.b;Nay, even the Prophet thinks this is too much a burden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2102.desc;A noble visiting from afar has gifted me with a very beautiful toothpick, crafted from the purest gold. It is encrusted with precious stones, and expertly carved into lovely, artistic shapes. Then again, there’s not much a point in wasting this toothpick for cleaning my teeth.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2102.a;It will do as a decoration in my bathroom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2103.desc;Today while talking with a visiting dignitary I learned from him that the men of Cathay prefer toothbrushes with harder, harsher bristles.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2103.a;What a brave people, those Chinese!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2103.b;Such stubbornness in their obsession to clean their teeth. Oh my.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2104.desc;I have such a lewd-minded courtier. Why, today, this fool has the audacity to explain the morally dubious things of a "romantic" nature one could do with a toothbrush! What sickening, horrific, disgusting, disgraceful, shameful, barbaric, animalistic, repulsive, vulgar ideas I am forced to listen to!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2104.a;Run out of the room before it's too late!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2104.b;Listen out of politeness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2104.c;Why... such ideas aren't half bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2104.d;Haha, what an amateur. An absolute amateur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_toothbrush_sexy_times_amateurs;If only they knew the sort of things I did with my sister…;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2105.desc;One of my older servants told me interesting advice pertaining to oral hygiene that he heard from some learned men. Apparently, it seems that one should clean not only one's teeth, but one's tongue as well. After all, disgusting things accumulate on the tongue as well, so why should we not give it as much focus as we do our teeth?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2105.a;Excellent advice. Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2106.desc;I noticed one of my Jewish courtiers tends to rinse their mouth with a strange concoction every now and then. Questioning them on the matter, I learned that this liquid was a mixture of dough water and olive oil, which the Talmhd advises as a cure for gum ailments.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2106.a;Interesting. I should try it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2106.b;Disgusting Jewish tricks, I will not fall for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2107.desc;Seeing all the older people with their horrid gums and decaying teeth makes me fear about how my mouth could end up like in the future. Therefore, I vow to take every step I can to improve my oral hygiene! I will eat and drink things beneficial to my teeth, for instance, and learn the best techniques for brushing my teeth.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2107.a;Even when I’m old and feeble, I WILL have good teeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2108.desc;I was a little too fixated with cleaning my teeth earlier today, and brushed with too much intensity, resulting in some slight bleeding from my gums. As a result, my teeth are covered in blood. Unfortunately, I have to meet with my court soon, even though I look like a man-eating bloodthirsty monster.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2108.a;Here goes…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2108.b;Thankfully, I look beautiful no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2108.c;This will only enhance my fearsome looks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.2109.desc;“By the way, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], I accidentally dropped your toothbrush in the chamber pot,” a courtier know for their pranks tells you. After you halt in shock, the courtier says, “I was just joking. Haha! You should’ve seen your face.
